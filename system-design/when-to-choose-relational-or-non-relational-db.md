#  Choose a Relational Database When:
    => 1. Your data is structured and consistent:
        a. Schema is predefined and rarely changes.
        b. You require strict data types and relationships (e.g., Foreign Keys)

       2. You need ACID Compliance:
        a. Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability are important - e.g., in banking, e-commerece etc.

       3. Data relationships are complex.
        a. Data is highly interconnected and benefits from joins (e.g., a customer placing multiple orders 
           that each contain multiple products).
       
       4. You want powerful querying with SQL.
        a. You rely heavily on ad hoc, complex queries, aggregations, and reporting.

       5. The application requires strong transactional integrity.
        a. Financial apps, ERP systems, and CRMs are good examples.

      #. Common Relational DB:   PostgreSQL, MySQL, Oracle, SQL server, MariaDB etc.

# Choose a Non-Relational Databse when:
    => 
      1. Your data is unstructured or semi-strctured.
        a. JSON, Key-value paris, documents, time-series, or graphs. schema can evolve over time.

      2. You need high scalability and performance.
        a. You expect huge volumes of data and need to scale horizontally (e.g, cloud-based distributed systems).

      3. You prioritize availability and partition tolerance (over consistency)
        a. Following the CAP theorem, NoSQL System often choose AP (Availability, Partion-tolerance).

      4. You handle vaaried or rapidly evolving data.
        a. Good for applications in early Stages or that need frequent iteration of the schema (like Social Media, IOT).

      5. You can use data models that aren't relational:
        example: 
        a. Document DB(e.g., MongoDB)  - flexible JSON-like Structure.
        b. Key-values stores (e.g., Redis)  - High-speed lookup.
        c. Column-family Stores(e.g., Cassandra)  - Great for large-scale time-series data.
        d. Graph DBs(e.g., Neo4j)  - For networked data like social graphs.

# Hybrid Use: Polyglot Persistence
      => In real-world systems, itâ€™s common to use both:
      1. SQL for transactional, structured data
      2. NoSQL for logging, caching, analytics, or unstructured content



# Factor	Relational (SQL)	Non-Relational (NoSQL)
