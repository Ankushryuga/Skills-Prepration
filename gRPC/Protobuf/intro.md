## Protobuf or Protocol buffers are language-neutral, platform-neutral, extensible mechanism for serializing structured data.

## Key features of Protobuf:
1. Binary format: protobuf uses binary format, which is smaller and faster to parse than text-based formats like JSON.
2. Language and Platform Neutral:
3. Extensible: protobuf allows you to add new fields to your data structures without breaking compatibility with older versions of data.
4. Schema-Based: Protobuf uses a schema defined in .proto file.

## Use cases:
1. Network communication
2. Data Storage: can be used to store data on disk in a compact and efficient format.
3. gRPC
4. Microservices: Protobuf is a popular choice for inter-service communicate in microservice architectures.


## Benefits:
1. Smaller Payload size: protobuf are in  binary format so its smaller message compared to JSON, reducing bandwidth usage.
2. Faster Serialization/Deserialization: Protobuf is significantly faster than JSON for both serializiing and deserializing.
3. Code generations
4. Type safety
