# 1. Tell me about yourself?



# Asking question to interviewer.
      => 1. "I would appreciate it if you could share your perspective on what it's like to work at a prestigious company like Apple.
            Your insights would be incredibly helpful as I prepare myself to react that level".

         2. I truly admire the work being done at Apple, and i'd love to hear what the experience has been like for you, Any insights you 
            could share would mean a lot as I work toward preparing myself for opportunities at that level.
