## 1. Tell me about yourself?
I am a software engineer with experience in full-stack development with 3+  year of experience using Java with spring boot, React, MySQL, PostgreSQL, MariaDB, MongoDB, gRPC, REST API, Node.js. My projects range 
from small to large scalable, robust, web applications, what's specially important for me is solving problems in a manner that is useful for people in the process. I have graduated with higher education in Computer
Science, after that i had done internships at coding ninja and startup Blutrain, while working for those companies, which helped me get stronger in problem-solving abilities and be attentive to details. 

I love challenges and equally relish the continuous learning of new technologies, which makes this opportunity quite exicting for me, i can only imagine the work your company is doing in relation to the industry or field,
which is really innovative, and i'd love to chip in my skills and experience to help the team achieve the goals.
