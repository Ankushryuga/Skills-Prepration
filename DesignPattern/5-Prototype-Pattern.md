# Prototype Pattern:
      => It used when the object creation is costly and requires a lot of time and resources, and you have a similar object already existing.
      So this pattern provides a mechanism to copy the original Object to a new Object and then modify it according to our needs. 
      This pattern uses Java cloning to copy the Object. The prototype design pattern mandates that the Object which you are copying should provide the copying feature
