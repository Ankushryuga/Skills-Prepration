1. CPU: often referred to as the brain of the computer, is responsible for executing instructions from programs.

2. CORE: its individual processing unit with a CPU. Modern CPUs can have multiple cors, allowing them to perform multiple tasks simultaneously.
    => A quad-core processor has 4 four cors, allowing it to perform 4 tasks simultaneously. For instance, one core could handle web browser, another other tasks..

3. Program: its a set of instruction written in a programming language that tells the computer how to perform a specific task.

4. Process: Its an instance of a program that is being executed. When a program runs, the OS creates a process to manage its execution.

5. Thread: its a smallest unit of execution within a process. A process can have multiple threads, which share the same resources but can run independently.

6. Multitasking: it allows an OS system to run multiple processes simultaneously. On single-core CPUs, this is done through time-sharing, rapidly switching b/w tasks. On multi-core CPUs, true parallel execution occurs, with task distributed across cores. The Os schedular balances the load, ensuring efficient and responsive system performance.

7. In a single core system: Both threads and process managed by the OS Scheduler through time slicing and context switching to create the illusion of simulateneous exection.

8. In a multi core system: Both threads and processes can run in true parallel on different cores, with the OS scheduler distributing tasks across the cores to optimize performance.
